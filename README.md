# Data-Science-Projects


This repository showcases a real-world AI project built using Python, LangChain, HuggingFace Transformers, Streamlit, and FAISS to demonstrate my capabilities as a data scientist in practical NLP applications.

I developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot that can intelligently answer user queries based on any uploaded document. The system mimics how real-world AI systems assist in legal, real estate, or financial document understanding by combining:

✅ Custom Embedding using TF-IDF for efficiency

✅ Contextual Search with FAISS

✅ Language Generation using Flan-T5 via HuggingFace

✅ Interactive UI built in Streamlit

This project reflects my understanding of embedding-based search, prompt engineering, and LLM-based QA systems, and demonstrates how I can apply modern AI tools to solve real-world problems.
