I built a personalized AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions based on any uploaded document using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. It combines traditional NLP (TF-IDF embedding) with a HuggingFace transformer model (Flan-T5) to provide accurate, context-aware answers. The app is designed using Streamlit, so it's fully interactive and easy to demo.
